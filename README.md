# Aggregate GDP and Population

**Objective:** The objective is to aggregate the Population and GDP of year 2012 of G20 Countries by continent. The intent is to understand the following things:

1. Objects
2. Arrays
3. Iterators
4. Conditionals

## Instructions for the Assignment

Write a NodeJS program to aggregate the Population and GDP of year 2012 of G20 Countries by
Continent in `output/output.json`.

The `datafile.csv` is present in the data folder, which you would want to aggregate.

In order to aggregate Countries by Continent you would have to rely on any external source, but the aggregated output should be in coherence with `test/expected-output.json`.

**Note:** No external node package can be used.
